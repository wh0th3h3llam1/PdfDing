## Introduction
<hr>

PdfDing is a PDF manager and viewer that you can host yourself. It offers a seamless user experience on multiple
devices. It's designed be to be minimal, fast, and easy to set up using Docker. As all data stays on your server
you have full control over your data and privacy.

With its simple, intuitive and adjustable UI, PdfDing makes it easy for users to keep track of their PDFs
and access them whenever they need to. With a dark mode and colored themes users can style the app to
their liking. As PdfDing offers SSO support via OIDC it can be easily integrated into existing setups.

The name is a combination of PDF and *ding*. Ding is the German word for thing. Thus, PdfDing is a thing for
your PDFs. The name and the design of PdfDing are inspired by [linkding](https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding).
Linkding is an excellent selfhostable bookmark manager. If you are unfamiliar with it be sure to check it out!

### Feature Overview

### Why PdfDing?
I started developing PdfDing as I was searching for a solution for viewing and managing PDF files.
I had a few simple requirements:

* view PDFs seamlessly in the browser of my desktop and mobile devices
* every user can upload files
* can be self-hosted via Docker
* minimal and resource-friendly
* SSO support

I was quite surprised to find out that there was no app matching my simple requirements. While there
were some existing solutions they still had some problems:

* They are using the inbuilt PDF viewer of the browser. This works fine on desktops and laptops but on smartphones
  it will simply download the PDF file and not display it in the browser.
* They are really feature rich and therefore resource-hungry. I do not need fancy AI or OCR. I just want
  to view and organize my PDFs.
* The content needs to be curated by an admin user. Normal users are not allowed to add PDFs.
* PDFs can not be uploaded via the UI.

Thus, I am developing PDfDing as a simple webapp with a clear focus on a single thing: viewing and managing PDFs.

## Installation
PdfDing is designed to be run with container solutions like Docker. The Docker image is compatible with ARM64 platforms,
so it can be run on a Raspberry Pi 4.

PdfDing uses an SQLite database by default. Alternatively PdfDing supports PostgreSQL.

### Using Docker

To install PdfDing using Docker you can just run the image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mrmn/pdfding):

```
docker run --name pdfding \
    -p 8000:8000 \
    -v sqlite_data:/home/nonroot/pdfding/db -v media:/home/nonroot/pdfding/media \
    -e HOST_NAME=127.0.0.1 -e SECRET_KEY=some_secret -e CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE=FALSE -e SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=FALSE \
    -d \
    mrmn/pdfding:latest
```

If everything completed successfully, the application should now be running
and can be accessed at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

If you use selinux it might be necessary to add the `:Z` after the volumes, e.g.
`sqlite_data:/home/nonroot/pdfding/db:Z`.

### Using Docker Compose
To install linkding using Docker Compose, you can use one of the files in the
[deploy](https://codeberg.org/mrmn/PdfDing/src/branch/master/deploy) directory and run e.g.:

```
docker-compose -d -f sqlite.docker-compose.yaml
```

### Admin user
If needed or wished it is possible to create an admin user. Admin users can view and delete users.
Creating an admin user is optional. To give a user admin rights execute
```
python pdfding/manage.py make_admin -e admin@pdfding.com
```
inside the shell of the running container and specify the correct email address.
Admin users can can also give other users admin rights via the ui.

### Single Sign on (SSO)
PdfDing supports SSO via OIDC. OIDC is set up by using environment variables:
```
OIDC_ENABLE: "TRUE"
OIDC_CLIENT_ID: "pdfding"
OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET: "client_secret"
OIDC_AUTH_URL: "https://auth.pdfding.com/.well-known/openid-configuration"
OIDC_PROVIDER_NAME: "Authelia"
```

More information about the environment variables can be found in the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

Once PdfDing is set up for using OIDC the same needs to be done on the OIDC identity provider's side. Of course, this
configuration depends on the used identity provider. Here is an example configuration
for [Authelia](https://www.authelia.com/):
```
oidc:
    ## The other portions of the mandatory OpenID Connect 1.0 configuration go here.
    ## See: https://www.authelia.com/c/oidc
    clients:
      - id: pdfding
            description: PdfDing
            # create client secret and hash with
            # docker run --rm authelia/authelia:latest authelia crypto rand --length 64 --charset alphanumeric
            secret: '$pbkdf2-sha512$310000$<rest_of_hashed_secret>'
            public: false
            authorization_policy: two_factor
            scopes:
              - openid
              - email
              - profile
            redirect_uris:
              - https://pdfding.com/accountoidc/login/callback/
```

## Backups

PdfDing supports automated backups to S3 compatible storage. During backups the Sqlite database and uploaded
PDF files will be backed up.

**IMPORTANT**: The backup of Postgres databases is as of now not supported. Postgres databases should be
backed up by using `pg_dump`.

### Enabling Backups
Backups are set up by using environment variables:
```
BACKUP_ENABLE: "TRUE"
BACKUP_SCHEDULE: "0 2 * * *"
BACKUP_ENDPOINT: 'minio.pdfding.com'
BACKUP_ACCESS_KEY: 'some_access_key'
BACKUP_SECRET_KEY: 'some_secret_key'
BACKUP_SECURE: 'FALSE'
```

More information about the environment variables can be found in the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

### Enabling Encrypted Backups
PDfDing supports encrypted backups. Encryption is done via Fernet, a symmetric encryption algorithm
provided by the [cryptography](https://cryptography.io/en/stable/fernet/#cryptography.fernet.Fernet)
library. Encrypted backups can be enabled by using environment variables:
```
BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_ENABLED: "TRUE"
BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD: 'some_password'
BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_SALT: 'some_salt'
```

**IMPORTANT: If you enable encrypted backups or change the encryption password/salt, it is absolutely necessary
to delete your existing backups in the S3 compatible storage. Not doing so will destroy your backup!**

### Recovering Data from Backups

PDFs and the Sqlite database can easily be recovered from the backups by executing
```
python pdfding/manage.py recover_data
```
inside the shell of the running container.

## Tech Stack
* The web app is build using the Python web framework [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
* Mozilla's [PDF.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/) is used for viewing PDF files in the browser
* The frondend is build using [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/), [htmx](https://htmx.org/),
[jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* Authentication, registration, account management and OIDC is achieved by [django-allauth](https://docs.allauth.org/en/latest/)

## Acknowledements
* This project started by adjusting the django starter of Andreas Jud: [django-starter](https://github.com/andyjud/django-starter), [django-starter-assets](https://github.com/andyjud/django-starter-assets)
* As mentioned above, inspired by [linkding](https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding).

## Contributing
PdfDing is open source, so you are free to modify or contribute. PdfDing is built using the Django web framework. You
can get started by checking out the excellent [Django docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/). Currently,
PdfDing consists of four applications:
* Inside the `pdf` folder is the one related to managing and viewing PDFs
* the folder `users` contains the logic related to users
* the admin area is implemented inside the `admin` folder
* `core` is the Django root application
* backups are handled inside `backup`

Other than that the code should be self-explanatory / standard Django stuff 🙂.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3
* pipx
* Poetry: `pipx install poetry`
* Node.js

### Pre-Commit
This project has support for `pre-commit` hooks. They are used for checking the code quality,
e.g. with: `black`, `flake8` and `bandit`. If `pre-commit` is installed on your system just run
```
pre-commit install
```
Now whenever you commit your changes the pre-commit hooks will be triggered. If you want to bypass
`pre-commit` for some reason just add `--no-verify` to your commit command, e.g.:
```
git commit -m 'some commit message' --no-verify
```


### Setup

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://codeberg.org/mrmn/PdfDing.git
```

cd into the project:
```
cd PdfDing
```

Create the virtual environment and install all dependencies:
```
poetry install
```

Activate the environment for your shell:
```
poetry shell
```

Install frontend dependencies:
```

npm ci
npm run build
```

Initialize the database:
```
python pdfding/manage.py migrate
```

Create a user for the frontend:
```
python pdfding/manage.py createsuperuser
```

Start the development server with:

```
# in one shell run
python pdfding/manage.py runserver
# in another run
npx tailwindcss -i pdfding/static/css/input.css -o pdfding/static/css/tailwind.css -c tailwind.config.js --watch
```
The frontend is now available under http://127.0.0.1:8000. Any changes in regard to Tailwind CSS will be automatically
reflected.

### Testing
